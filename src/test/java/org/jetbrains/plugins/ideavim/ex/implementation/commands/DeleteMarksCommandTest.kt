         The features it combines mark it as new
         to science: shape and shade -- the special tinge,
         akin to moonlight, tempering its blue,
         the dingy underside, the checquered fringe.

         My needles have teased out its sculpted sex;
         corroded tissues could no longer hide
         that priceless mote now dimpling the convex
         and limpid teardrop on a lighted slide.
