/*
For the following four commands the cursor follows the screen.  If the
character that the cursor is on is moved off the screen, the cursor is moved
to the closest character that is on the screen.  The value of 'sidescroll' is
not used.

                                                       *zH*
zH                      Move the view on the text half a screenwidth to the
                        left, thus scroll the text half a screenwidth to the
                        right.  This only works when 'wrap' is off.

[count] is used but undocumented.
